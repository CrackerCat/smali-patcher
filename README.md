# SmaliPatcher.JF
A "fork" of the decompiled code of [SmaliPatcher](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-smali-patcher-0-7-t3680053) by fOmey\
Supports Linux (maybe android and macOS, although they are not tested and not in CI) devices.\
The functionality should basically be the same as SmaliPatcher 6.9\
